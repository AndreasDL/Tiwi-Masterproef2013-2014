TITLE="Health Monitoring of Federated Future Internet Experimentation Facilities",
BOOKTITLE="European Conference on Networks and Communications 2014 (EuCNC 2014)",
ADDRESS="Bologna, Italy",
DAYS=23,
MONTH=jun,
YEAR=2014,
KEYWORDS="Future Internet Experimentation Facilities, FIRE, Fed4FIRE, health
monitoring, federation, support, operations",
ABSTRACT="The federation of Future Internet testbeds as envisaged by the Fed4FIRE
project is a complex undertaking. It combines a large number of existing,
independent testbeds in a single federation, and presents them to the
experimenter as if it were a single infrastructure. Operating and using
such an infrastructure requires a profound knowledge of the status of the
health of the underlying independent systems. Inspired by network
monitoring techniques used to operate the Internet today, this paper
considers how a centralized health monitoring system can be set up in a
federated environment of Future Internet Experimentation Facilities. We
show why it is a vital tool for experimenters and First Level Support in
the federation, which health monitoring information must be captured, and
how this information can be displayed most appropriately."
