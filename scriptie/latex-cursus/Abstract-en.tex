\chapter*{Abstract}
\npar
Due to the new cloud based technologies, network protocols and network reachability are now more important than ever. To make this change quick and clean, we need more and more network research. This reseach heavily relies on testbeds to simulate networks. These testbeds are controlled via software tools. In this thesis we will look at jFed, a java tool developed in the European FED4FIRE project. The current situation has a few downsides. It's very hard for researchers to determine if a certain behavior is caused by the testconfiguration or by the testbed. 
\npar
This thesis will try to solve that matter, by automating the testbed monitoring.
A webservice will then share this information. This webservice will show how reliable a testbed is. The webservice could then be used to notify the researcher of problems via his primary user interface.
